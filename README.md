#nxtOSEK setup instructions for arch linux
This repository includes the scripts that I used to create a compiler toolchain to flash NXT mindstorms with nxtOSEK. The instructions are based on (http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/installation_linux.htm)

## GNU arm compiler
### Requirements
The scripts builds a compiler for the arm 7 core inside the LEGO brick. 
The script is build using gcc 4.4 (later version of gcc 4.x might also work).
