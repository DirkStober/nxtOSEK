#nxtOSEK setup instructions for arch linux
This repository includes the scripts that I used to create a compiler toolchain to flash NXT mindstorms with nxtOSEK. The instructions are based on (http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/installation_linux.htm)

## GNU arm compiler

### Requirements
* gcc 4.4 (other 4.x versions might also work (not 4.3 though))
* texinfo 4.13 (See texinfo section for downgrading)

### Installation
Use the script build_arm_toolchain.sh
